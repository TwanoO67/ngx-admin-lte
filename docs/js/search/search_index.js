to integrate in your own project.\nIf your are looking for a full bootstrapping using this library, please check: Bootstrapping Ngx-Admin-Lte\nDocumentation\nDocumentation is available here Documentation\nSupport & Contribution\nThis project is maintained on personnal time.\nAs so weI can't assure you that all questions/issues will be answered as quickly as you need.\nBut the communauty around it is growing fast, more than 200 projects are using it\nAnd it's an open-source project, so feel free to add feature / fix issues via Pull Requests (they will be merged quickly).\nFurthermore, if you like this project and you do want to help us, please considere donating.\nEvery little help is welcome :)\n\nInstallation\nThis lib is only tested on angular-cli projects, but it may work in any angular project.\nInstall this lib in your existing project with\nyarn add ngx-admin-lte or npm install ngx-admin-lte\n  in your app.modules.ts, add these statements:\n  import { NgxAdminLteModule } from 'ngx-admin-lte';\n\n  @NgModule({\n  // ...\n  imports: [\n    // ...\n    NgxAdminLteModule,  Add js and css of admin-lte in your project like so:\nin your angular-cli.json\n  \"assets\": [\n    { \"glob\": \"**/*\", \"input\": \"../node_modules/ngx-admin-lte/public/assets\", \"output\": \"./assets\" }\n  ],\n  \"scripts\": [\n    \"../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js\",\n    \"../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\",\n    \"../node_modules/admin-lte/dist/js/app.min.js\"\n  ],in your style.css\n  @import \"../node_modules/angular2-toaster/toaster.css\";\n  @import \"../node_modules/admin-lte/dist/css/AdminLTE.min.css\";\n  @import \"../node_modules/admin-lte/dist/css/skins/_all-skins.min.css\";\n  @import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\";\n  @import \"../node_modules/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css\";\n  @import \"../node_modules/ionicons/dist/css/ionicons.min.css\";then you can declare your component with the adminLte template in your router:\n  import { CanActivateGuard, LayoutAuthComponent } from 'ngx-admin-lte';\n  ...\n  const routes: Routes = [\n    // logged routes\n    {\n      canActivate: [CanActivateGuard],\n      children: [\n        {\n          canActivate: [CanActivateGuard],\n          component: HomeComponent,\n          path: 'home'\n        },\n        {\n          canActivate: [CanActivateGuard],\n          component: PageNumComponent,\n          path: 'page/:id'\n        },\n      ],\n      component: LayoutAuthComponent,\n      path: '',\n    },\n    // not logged routes\n    {\n      component: LayoutLoginComponent,\n      path: 'login'\n    },\n    {\n      component: RegisterComponent,\n      path: 'register'\n    }\n  ];Handling Translation\nIn order to use the translation files given by the libraries, you should configure your angular-cli as:\n   { \"glob\": \"**/*\", \"input\": \"../node_modules/ngx-admin-lte/src/public/assets\", \"output\": \"./assets\" }But if you want to provide your own translation files, lets say in a folder named \"src/public/i18n\" in your project.\n( That you could have initialised it by doing cp -r ./node_modules/ngx-admin-lte/src/public/assets/i18n ./src/public/ in your project)\nYou could do that like so:\n    { \"glob\": \"**/*\", \"input\": \"../node_modules/ngx-admin-lte/src/public/assets/img\", \"output\": \"./assets/img\" },\n    { \"glob\": \"**/*\", \"input\": \"./public/i18n\", \"output\": \"./assets/i18n\" }Same principle applies if you want to override the \"img\" assets folder\nConfiguration\nYou can change skin and hide some buttons by passing data to the layout component like so:\n  component: LayoutAuthComponent,\n  data: [{\n      'skin': 'skin-black',\n      /*\n      // USE THIS IS YOU WANT TO HIDE SOME TEMPLATE PART\n      'boxed_style': false,\n      'display_tasks': false,\n      'display_control': false,\n      'display_user': false,\n      'display_messages': false,\n      'display_notifications': false,\n      'display_menu_user': false,\n      'display_menu_search': false,\n      'display_logout': true,\n      header_components: []\n      */\n    }],DEPRECATED:\nPlease don't use 'menu_title' anymore, you can just set 'header' property in your links setting.\nDon't forget to import the css skin in you style.css if you use it.\nAdditionnal components\nYou can add some components in the header by adding some in the configuration of the layout like so:\n'header_components': [{\n  class: MenuWidgetComponent,\n  data: {\n    label: 'test widget'\n  }\n}]the same structure can be used in the menu configuration to add components in the left menu.\nimport { MenuWidgetComponent } from './widgets/menu-widget/menu-widget.component';\n...\nlet mylinks = [\n  //some standard link ...\n    {\n      'title': 'External Links',\n      'icon': 'link',\n      'sublinks': [\n        {\n          'title': 'Github',\n          'link': ['https://github.com/TwanoO67/ngx-admin-lte'],\n          'icon': 'github',\n          'external': true,\n          'target': '_blank'\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    // and an additionnal component\n    {\n      class: MenuWidgetComponent,\n      data: {\n        label: 'test component'\n      }\n    }\n  ];\n// then define the menu\n    this.menuService.setCurrent(this.mylinks);Don't forget to add your component to the declarations and entryComponents part of your module file.\nThose components must implement OnChanges (so they can receive data)\nServices\nIf you need some practical example of using this services, check out the project Bootstraping-ngx-admin-lte\nBreadcrumbService\nHelper to set the breadcrumb in a LayoutAuthComponent extended page.\nExample for an homepage:\n  constructor(\n    private breadServ: BreadcrumbService\n  ) {\n\n  public ngOnInit() {\n    // settings the header for the home\n    this.breadServ.setCurrent({\n      description: 'HomePage',\n      display: true,\n      header: 'Dashboard',\n      levels: [\n        {\n          icon: 'dashboard',\n          link: ['/'],\n          title: 'Home'\n        }\n      ]\n    });\n  }\n\n  public ngOnDestroy() {\n    // removing the header\n    this.breadServ.clear();\n  }CanActivateGuard\nService that check if the user is connected.\nIf you want to use it, just put in you routes like, so;\n  import { CanActivateGuard } from 'ngx-admin-lte';\n\n  // ...\n  {\n    component: MyComponent,\n    canActivate: [CanActivateGuard],\n    path: 'mycompo'\n  }And set a user.connected = true in your user service.\nExample of a basic login page:\n  constructor(\n    private userServ: UserService,\n    private router: Router\n  ) {\n\n  private login() {\n    // DOING SOME BACKOFFICE STUFF ON THE SERVER\n\n    // then if the server said OK, then log the user in js\n    if ( 1 === 1 ) {\n\n      const user1 = new User( {\n          avatarUrl: 'assets/img/user2-160x160.jpg',\n          email: 'weber.antoine@outlook.com',\n          firstname: 'WEBER',\n          lastname: 'Antoine'\n      } );\n\n      user1.connected = true;\n\n      this.userServ.setCurrent( user1 );\n\n      this.router.navigate( ['home'] );\n    }\n  }FooterService\nHelper to define the footer of an LayoutAuthComponent extended page.\nuse setCurrent to send your footer with { left_part: \"some text or\", right_part: \"some html\"}\nLoggerService\nthe method log is used to show some console.log using the i18n translation\nLogoService\nHelper to define the logo of an LayoutAuthComponent extended page.\nuse setCurrent to send your logo with {\n  html_mini; \"ALTE\",\n  html_lg; \"AdminLTE\",\n}\nYou can define your own brand name in the logo, if you want it to be initialised once, do it in your app.compontent.ts like so:\n  import { LogoService } from 'ngx-admin-lte';\n\n  constructor(\n    private logoServ: LogoService\n    ){\n\n  // ...\n\n  this.logoServ.setCurrentLogo({\n    html_mini; \"ALTE\",\n    html_lg; \"AdminLTE\",\n  });Please remove any usage of it.\nMenuService\nYou can set the menu links, globally (if you do that in your app.component.ts for example),\nor locally, if you do that in each of your component.\nimport { User, MenuService, Message, MessagesService } from 'ngx-admin-lte';\n\n// ...\n\n// define here your own links menu structure\nprivate mylinks: any = [\n  {\n    'header': 'Custom Header'\n  },\n  {\n    'title': 'Home',\n    'icon': 'dashboard',\n    'link': ['/']\n  },\n  {\n    'title': 'Sub menu',\n    'icon': 'link',\n    'sublinks': [\n      {\n        'title': 'Page 2',\n        'link': ['/page/2'],\n      },\n      {\n        'title': 'Page 3',\n        'link': ['/page/3'],\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n];\n\nconstructor(\n  private menuServ: MenuService,\n  private msgServ: MessagesService\n) {\n\n}\n\npublic ngOnInit() {\n  // define menu\n  this.menuServ.setCurrentMenu(this.mylinks);MessagesService\nCan be used to send message in the message box of the header\nExample:\nconstructor(\n    private msgServ: MessagesService,\n    // ...\n  ) {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  public ngOnInit() {\n    // FAKE MESSAGE\n    // defining some users\n    const user1 = new User( {\n        avatarUrl: 'assets/img/user2-160x160.jpg',\n        email: 'weber.antoine.pro@gmail.com',\n        firstname: 'WEBER',\n        lastname: 'Antoine'\n    });\n    const user2 = new User( {\n        avatarUrl: 'assets/img/user2-160x160.jpg',\n        email: 'EMAIL',\n        firstname: 'FIRSTNAME',\n        lastname: 'LASTNAME'\n    });\n\n    // sending a test message\n    this.msgServ.addMessage( new Message( {\n        author: user2,\n        content: 'le contenu d\\'un message d\\'une importance extreme',\n        destination: user1,\n        title: 'un message super important'\n    }) );NotificationsService\nCan be used to send notification in the notification box of the header\nExample:\nconstructor(\n    ...\n    private notifServ: NotificationsService\n  ) {\n    ...\n  }\n\n  public ngOnInit() {\n    // sending a test notification\n    this.notifServ.addNotification( new Notification( {\n        class: 'fa fa-users text-aqua',\n        content: '5 new members joined today',\n        link: '/page/2'\n    }) );RestService\nAbstract service to contact a REST API.\nYou can use that to do Services for you data models.\nExample, for a model named \"Device\"\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Http, Response, Headers } from '@angular/http';\nimport 'rxjs/add/operator/map'\nimport { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';\nimport { Device } from '../../models/device';\nimport { RestService } from \"ngx-admin-lte\";\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class DeviceService extends RestService {\n\n  constructor(_http: Http) {\n      super(_http);\n      this.modelName = 'devices';\n      this.setApiUrl('http://my-rest_api_to_contact/devices');\n  }\n\n  /*This parts are only needed if you want to have correct types for your datas*/\n  public getAll(): Observable{\n    return super.getAll().map((tab)=> {\n      return tab.map(unit => new Device(unit) );\n    });\n  }\n\n  public get(id: number): Observable{\n      return super.get(id).map((unit) => unit);\n  }\n\n}This service will now provide base CRUD functionality respecting the RESP in JSON API format.\n// CONFIGURATION\nsetApiUrl( url: string)\n\n// HELPERS WITH CACHE\ngetAllFromLS(maxtime = 0): Array\ngetFromCache(id): any\n\n// Standard REST functions\ngetAll(): Observable\nget(id: number): Observable\nadd(item: any): Observable\naddAll(tab: Array): Observable>\nupdate(id: number, itemToUpdate: any): Observable\ndelete(id: number): ObservableTranslateService\nThis service will listen to your user changes and check if the current user has a selected language (in the field preferredLang).\nIf so, it will change the language of the app, accordingly.\nUse the UserService to change the user, with language set like so:\nnew User( {\n    avatarUrl: 'assets/img/user2-160x160.jpg',\n    email: 'weber.antoine@outlook.com',\n    firstname: 'WEBER',\n    lastname: 'Antoine'\n    //set the language here\n    preferredLang: 'fr'\n} );Supported language are: 'en', 'fr', 'ru', 'he', 'zh'\nIf no preferredLang is given, it will take the browser settings, and otherwise default is 'en'.\nUser service\nThis service is used to send/get the current user information across the app\nFor example you can set the current user, in your login page :\nimport { User, UserService } from 'ngx-admin-lte';\n\nconstructor(\n  private _user_serv: UserService\n){\n\nngOnInit(){\n  let user = new User({\n    firstname: \"WEBER\",\n    lastname: \"Antoine\",\n    email: \"why-not-yop@yopmail.com\",\n    avatarUrl: \"assets/img/user2-160x160.jpg\"\n  });\n  this._user_serv.setCurrentUser( user );and you can get the user in a widget:\nimport { User, UserService } from 'ngx-admin-lte';\n\nprivate current_user: User;\nconstructor(\n  private _user_serv : UserService,\n){\n  //se connecter au modification du user courant\n  this._user_serv.current_user.subscribe((user: User) => this.current_user = user);Specific Components\nApp Header\nThis widget handles the header bar, it includes other 'box' widgets for the top navigation:\n\nMessages Box\nNotification Box\nTasks Box\nUser box\n\nMessages Box\nThis widget is registered to the messages service\nNotification Box\nWIP This widget is registered to the notification service\nTasks Box\nWIP This widget is registered to the task service\nUser
